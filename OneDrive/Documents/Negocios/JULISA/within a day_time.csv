I am an adventurous and positive person. To learn from others and see the world in new perspectives makes me grow as a person and I enjoy doing that a lot. I try to live day by day as much as it's possible, and for now I really like that way to live.

I can spend hours getting to know a person by having random conversations and listen to their stories. That could be anything from everyday life stories, long and deep conversations about life, sharing thoughts and emotions,... let's find out what we have to share with each other, plant seeds and let them grow ;)

Seeing the world in a positive way already helped me out a lot in different situations on my way.

- please smile for a second - doesn't it feel great! -

Things I like (to do):
Freediving | conversations | culture and language exchanges | (acro)yoga | music | nature | broccoli | rocks | water | laughing | cooking sessions | .....

Ich liebe und interessiere mich für die Menschen und mit Ihren mir erzählten Lebensgeschichten und Erzählungen könnte ich schon ein Buch füllen.
Ein gemeinsames Lebensziel von meinem Mann und mir war etwas Altes der Nachwelt zu erhalten. Dieses Ziel konnten wir mit der Rettung der ""Alten Villa"" verwirklichen, die abgerissen hätte sein sollen. Ich glaube, die Rettung und Renovierung ist uns gut gelungen - sehen Sie sich die Fotos an! :-)
Und die interessante Geschichte der Villa erzähle ich Ihnen gerne, wenn ich auch Sie , als lieben Gast,  begrüßen darf...

Ich bin Edit, eine gebürtige Budapester Lehrerin, seit fast 50 Jahren mit Dieter,  einem echten Wiener, glücklich verheiratet. Wir haben drei Kinder und 8 Enkelkinder, die uns jung und agil erhalten. Seit33 Jahren führe ich die Pension Anzengruber, wo ich vom Island bis zu den Fidschi Inseln  Gäste begrüßen konnte, von denen viele zu Freunden geworden sind. Ich liebe und interessiere mich für die Menschen und mit Ihren mir erzählten Lebensgeschichten und Erzählungen könnte ich schon ein Buch füllen.
Ein gemeinsames Lebensziel von meinem Mann und mir war etwas Altes der Nachwelt zu erhalten. Dieses Ziel konnten wir mit der Rettung der ""Alten Villa"" verwirklichen, die abgerissen hätte sein sollen. Ich glaube, die Rettung und Renovierung ist uns gut gelungen - sehen Sie sich die Fotos an! :-)
Und die interessante Geschichte der Villa erzähle ich Ihnen gerne, wenn ich auch Sie , als lieben Gast,  begrüßen darf... 
Bis bald! 
Herzlichst  Edit (ohne h:-)

To combine these two aspects - create a design apartment that meets our requirements as travellers and as architects - was our challenge.

The Experiences we have gained in our own extensive travels on all continents and the hospitality we have received from people around the world have motivated us to create an atmosphere in which you enjoy comfort combined with classic design - a convenience to make you feel at home.

We have learned on our journeys is that it all comes down to the people. Hospitality is not related to income and a warm smile is not a question of education. Our wish is to pass on a little of both and hoping you feel like at home away from home.

We would be delighted to personally welcome you as our guest in one of our apartments soon.
